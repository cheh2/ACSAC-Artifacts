Feature: Exploit bzl-ctrl-03

  Background:
    Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
    And I am logged in as an administrator

  Scenario: Adding a new promotion with usage limit
    Given I want to create a new promotion
    When I specify its code as "FULL_METAL_PROMOTION"
    And I name it "Full metal promotion"
    And I set its usage limit to -50
    And I add it
    Then I should be notified that it has been successfully created
    And the "Full metal promotion" promotion should be available to be used only 50 times
      Expected a value to be true. Got: false (Webmozart\Assert\InvalidArgumentException)
